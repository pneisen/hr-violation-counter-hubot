# HR Violation Counter Hubot
A little hubot script I wrote for a Bullshipit (bullshit + shipit) day at work. It accepts incrementing of a counter that tracks "HR violations."

Features:
* Attribution of violations to chat room users or names.
* Statistics of violations.
* Monitoring of public channels for a few common words.
* Counter displayed as a series of images.
